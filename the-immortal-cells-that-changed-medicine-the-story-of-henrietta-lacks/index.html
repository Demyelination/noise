That‚Äôs essentially what happened with the cells taken from <strong>Henrietta Lacks</strong> in 1951.</p><p>When this woman, who was being treated for aggressive cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, had a biopsy, doctors took some of her tumor tissue. At the time, this was standard practice‚Äîno one asked permission to use the cells for research.</p><p>A scientist named George Gey took those cells and tried to grow them in a lab dish, like starting a garden. Every other human cell he had ever tried withered and died in a few days. But Henrietta‚Äôs cells? They were different. They acted like <strong>zombie cells</strong>; they just kept dividing, doubling every day. Gey had accidentally found the world‚Äôs first <strong>immortal human cell line</strong>, which he named <strong>HeLa</strong> (using the first two letters of her name).</p><p>These HeLa cells became the ultimate research tool. They are like a universal test subject. Scientists used them as <strong>live targets</strong> to grow and test the <strong>polio vaccine</strong>‚Äîa massive undertaking that required huge quantities of human cells. They‚Äôve helped us map the human <strong>genome</strong> (the body‚Äôs instruction manual), figure out how viruses like <strong>HPV</strong> work (the very thing that caused her cancer), and develop treatments for everything from HIV to COVID-19.</p><p>The sheer volume of what these cells accomplished is staggering; it‚Äôs estimated that the total mass of all the HeLa cells ever grown could circle the Earth multiple times.</p><p>The key takeaway here is the trade-off: Henrietta Lacks‚Äô unfortunate end led to incredible progress that has saved countless lives. However, her story is a permanent, stark lesson in <strong>bioethics</strong>. Her family lived without knowing her tissue was being mass-produced and commercialized for decades, highlighting a deep, historical failure in asking for‚Äîor respecting‚Äî<strong>informed consent</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="go-deeper">Go Deeper:</h2><p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/henrietta-lacks/importance-of-hela-cells">The Importance of HeLa Cells</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa">HeLa - Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/who-was-henrietta-lacks-heres-how-hela-cells-became-essential-to-medical-research">Who was Henrietta Lacks?
